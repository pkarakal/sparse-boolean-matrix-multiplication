# FindBoost
# --------
# Boost is a set of libraries for the C++
# programming language that provides support
# for tasks and structures such as linear algebra,
# pseudorandom number generation, multithreading,
# image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing.
#
# This will define the following variables::
#
# BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Boost include directories
# BOOST_LIBRARIES - the Boost libraries
# BOOST_FOUND - A boolean that checks if Boost is found
